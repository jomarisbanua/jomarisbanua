## üìä Projects Overview

Below are my health tech projects that demonstrate my expertise in healthcare data analysis and machine learning:

1. **Heart Disease Prediction**: Predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease using health metrics like cholesterol and blood pressure.
2. **Diabetes Onset Prediction**: Develop a model to predict the onset of diabetes using clinical parameters such as BMI and glucose.
3. **Patient Readmission Prediction**: Analyze patient data to predict the likelihood of readmission within 30 days after discharge.
4. **COVID-19 Data Analysis and Forecasting**: Track and forecast COVID-19 cases with time series models and data visualization.
5. **Medical Image Classification**: Classify X-ray images to detect pneumonia using a convolutional neural network.
6. **Sentiment Analysis of Health-Related Reviews**: Assess patient sentiment using natural language processing techniques.
